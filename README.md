# 📈 AI-Powered Marketing Optimization Platform

This project is a proof-of-concept platform that uses ML and API integrations to optimize Meta Ads performance and analyze Shopify sales data.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Meta Ad campaign clustering and performance analysis
- Shopify revenue forecasting using regression
- Predictive budgeting with smart recommendations
- A/B test suggestions for underperforming campaigns
- Ad spend ROI tracking by connecting Meta campaigns to Shopify LTV
- Optional Slack/email alerts for significant performance drops
- Interactive dashboard built with Next.js + Recharts
- FastAPI backend exposing ML-powered APIs

---

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

The platform is structured with a clean separation between the ML engine, API backend, and frontend dashboard. Here's how data flows:

1. **Data Simulation**: Sample Meta Ads and Shopify data are generated to replicate real-world marketing activity.
2. **ML Insights**: Python notebooks analyze data to cluster campaigns, forecast revenue, and generate recommendations.
3. **API Layer**: FastAPI serves this data through structured endpoints like `/meta/insights` and `/shopify/forecast`.
4. **Dashboard**: A Next.js frontend fetches this data and renders performance metrics, charts, and recommendations using Tailwind and shadcn/ui.
5. **Alerts**: Email and Slack notification hooks are available for sudden performance shifts, handled via FastAPI utilities.
